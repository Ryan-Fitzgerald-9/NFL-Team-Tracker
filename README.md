# NFL-Team-Tracker

NFL Team Tracker is a mock app where you can keep updates on your favorite team, for this demo I created a page for the New England Ptriots (25 players from the offense).

The user can navigate the menu to update the roster by creating or removing players. The user will be able to change these items through interactive player cards and Add Player form. There is full CRUD on the back-end (MongoDB) with create/delete options on the front-end.

## Initial Process

With the idea of an NFL tracker, the initial data relationships can be observed in the following ERD.
